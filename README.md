# React Typescript Monorepo

Starter template for React / Typescript libraries using tsup and Yarn workspaces.

This is setup with a Semantic Release workflow based off Conventional Commits. And it's automatically released to Github and NPM using Github Actions.

## Development

There's a NextJS website under `packages/docs` to be a playground to develop and test the library.

1. Fork/clone this repo: `https://github.com/whoisryosuke/react-typescript-monorepo-2022.git`
1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
1. Build the library: `yarn build`
1. Start the NextJS playground: `yarn dev`

## Building package

1. `yarn build`

This runs the `tsup` process for one package/module. Check the `package.json` and `packages/gamepad-debug-ui/package.json` for more info.

## Adding packages

1. Rename the `packages/gamepad-debug-ui` folder to your package/module name.
1. Edit the `packages/your-new-pkg/package.json` and change the package/module name (as well as other details - like author).
1. Edit the root `package.json` and change the `build` and `release` scripts to reference your new package/module name (you can also just find/replace across all files)

## Release to Github/NPM

This repo should automatically release to Github and tag the release when you commit to `main`, `alpha`, or `beta` branches (change these in `package.json`).

You can learn more about the CI/CD workflow in the Github Actions folder.

### Setting up NPM

To setup NPM releases, you need to add your token to Github as an ENV var.

1. Make sure you've created a new repo for your package (not a fork).
1. Go to your repo settings.
1. Go to Environments
1. Create a new one called `production`
1. Add a `NPM_TOKEN` ENV with your token from NPM.

### Lint and Code Formatting

If you use VSCode, Prettier should run each time you save a compatible file.

> If you don't like this, go to `.vscode\settings.json` and disable there (or you can do it via your own VSCode settings).

`yarn lint` runs ESLint and Prettier, automatically formats files and rewrites them. Make sure to stage your code before running just in case.
